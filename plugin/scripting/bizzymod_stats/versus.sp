/**
 * versus.sp — match/map/round tracking for Versus / Realism Versus / Scavenge.
 *
 * Terminology (this is where people trip up):
 *   match  = one whole campaign (all chapters). Rarely finishes — players leave.
 *   map    = one CHAPTER, i.e. BOTH halves (you play Survivor once and Infected
 *            once). This is what a player colloquially calls "a round of versus",
 *            and it reliably completes because you must finish it to progress.
 *   round  = one HALF (one team on Survivors). Two per map.
 *
 * Because whole matches almost never finish, per-player versus stats are rolled
 * up PER MAP (per chapter) at chapter close — not at match close.
 *
 * ── Async coordination (this build resolves ids via async DB callbacks) ──
 * g_CurrentMapId is resolved by a 2-hop async chain (INSERT maps -> SELECT id ->
 * OnMapLookup) and is STALE during the synchronous OnMapStart handler. So chapter
 * boundaries are detected on the synchronously-fresh engine map NAME (g_CurrentMap
 * vs g_ChapterMapName), but the match_maps row is only opened once the id is
 * actually resolved. The open is driven by TryOpenPendingChapter(), called from
 * BOTH OnMapLookup (id ready) and OnMatchInserted (match id ready) — whichever
 * lands last opens the chapter. Latches (g_ChapterPending / g_RoundLivePending /
 * g_ChapterOpening / g_MapIdFresh) bridge the async gaps so no chapter or half is
 * dropped because an id hadn't landed yet.
 *
 * ── Round liveness (real half vs phantom) ──
 * mutation12 fires spurious round_starts during ready-up / the scenario restart
 * BETWEEN a chapter's two survivor runs. A round_start only opens a CANDIDATE
 * window; it is counted as a real half (ordinal + match_rounds row) only once it
 * goes LIVE — survivors leave the saferoom (player_left_start_area) or real combat
 * happens. A phantom never goes live, so at round_end it is discarded without
 * consuming the chapter's 2-half quota — which is what lets the real SECOND
 * survivor run be captured instead of being blocked.
 *
 * ── Chapter boundaries (map NAME) ──
 * On mutation12 the engine fires OnMapStart more than once per chapter (a scenario
 * restart between the halves, and often another after them). A new match_map opens
 * ONLY when the engine map NAME changes; same-map restarts are ignored, and the
 * two halves are gated by g_MapRoundOrdinal (<2). This kills the ghost/duplicate
 * match_maps.
 *
 * ── Sides / survivor team (settled sides + forced alternation) ──
 * The engine's per-half side swap RACES round_start inconsistently on this build,
 * so a round_start-time side read is unreliable. The two halves of a chapter ALWAYS
 * alternate which team plays Survivors, so we ANCHOR the chapter's first-half
 * survivor letter from the settled round_end sides (stable at a chapter's start)
 * and FORCE the second half to the opposite letter. Team letters (persistent A/B)
 * are anchored once from the match's first half; a player's SIDE flips each half,
 * their LETTER never does. Per-player side is then DERIVED from (letter ==
 * survivor-letter-this-half), which is robust to the swap-timing race, and the
 * letter is cleared on disconnect so a reused client slot can't inherit it.
 *
 * Two parallel counter banks:
 *   g_Clients[client].*       — session-scoped (drives player_stats), owned by session.sp
 *   g_RoundClients[client].*  — round(half)-scoped (drives player_round_stats), owned here
